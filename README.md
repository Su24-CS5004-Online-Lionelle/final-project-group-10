For our group project, we created a program utilizing a GUI that allows the user to search for information related to Rick and Morty characters. Our program utilizes a free [Rick and Morty Character API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/). We build the link for the search requests by [adding filters to their character schema](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#filter-characters) to get the character records that match the search criteria.

The user can add search criteria by name, filter by gender, filter by status, and filter by species. The search results are sorted by name, and the user can display these results in ascending or descending order by name. If there are many results, then the results are split up into pages, and the user can navigate the results page by page. The user can also export the results to a file in XML, JSON, and CSV formats. Please see the manual linked below for more detailed information on how to use the program.
